# Take a signed permanent reference for a blob representation and turn it into an expiring service URL for download.
# Note: These URLs are publicly accessible. If you need to enforce access protection beyond the
# security-through-obscurity factor of the signed blob and variation reference, you'll need to implement your own
# authenticated redirection controller.
